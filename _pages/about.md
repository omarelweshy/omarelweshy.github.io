I'm a backend-focused software engineer with over 3 years of experience making sure the magic behind the scenes actually works. I’ve dived into everything from FinTech to Blockchain, Logistics, and Web Dev, building systems that can handle the chaos of real-world users. I speak fluent Python, TypeScript, Golang, Java, and SQL, and while I’ve played with frontend frameworks like React and Next.js, my heart is really in the backend with Django, Node.js, Gin, and Spring Boot.

On the DevOps side, I’ve gotten cozy with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and GCP. Oh, and Linux is my go-to playground—because who doesn’t love a good terminal? I’ve also tinkered with Redis, gRPC, GraphQL, and other fun stuff. The best part? I’m always learning something new and love picking up new tools and tech—it’s what keeps this job exciting and keeps me on my toes!
